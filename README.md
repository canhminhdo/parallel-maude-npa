### A Parallel Version of Maude-NPA
---
Maude-NPA uses breadth-first search to perform the backward reachability analysis for cryptographic protocols. Hence, it is possible to do parallel BFS naturally.

This repo contains a parallel version of Maude-NPA by parallelizing the breadth-first search in which meta-interpreter is used.
